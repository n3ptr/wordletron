A bot that does the wordle

Wordle became wildly popular at the end of 2021 and after having fun playing the game I decided that what could be more fun than automating the game? 

The effort in this bot is broken down into two phases:

Part 1. data exploration
1. what words are compatible how large is this dataset?
2. of the acceptable words, which one is the best to start with?
    * this portion itself seemed to be a popular challenge among developers and the data savvy.

Part 2. the bot
1. pull in our dataset, and pick a starting word
2. navigate to [powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html "or now https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html")

3. write and read from the site the site to enter our words!
